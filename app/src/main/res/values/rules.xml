    <array name="rules_entries">
        <item>Pub Golf is a gentleman/gentlelady\'s game. Decorum shall be maintained throughout. Neither larger-loutism nor association football will be tolerated.</item>
        <item>Golf attire is required on the course. Those not suitably dressed will receive a 2-shot penalty. This includes both hand- and knit-wear.</item>
        <item>Golf is a trusting game. However, all shots must be taken within sight of an impartial umpire (or other player) for score verification. Video evidence may be required in the case of a \'perfect round\'.</item>
        <item>\'Kicking the ball up the course\' through careless drink handling will result in a 3-shot penalty.</item>
        <item>Slow play will be penalised by a 2-shot penalty.</item>
        <item>The golfing party is an inseparable coterie. <b>All</b> players shall play <b>all</b> holes together. There will be no omissions. Latecomers should play the course properly, albeit quickly. Alternatively, they should replicate the preceding holes (in the correct order) at the current hole.</item>
        <item>A \'gimme\' is not defined in pub golf. Those unable to finish a hole will receive a 12 on their scorecard. Get better freshman.</item>
        <item>The rights of water-closet visitation are reserved for players who have completed a hole. \'Irrigating the fairway\' is frowned upon, and testing a hole\'s groundkeeper on the subject is not recommended.</item>
        <item>Spitting has no place on a golf course. Any player who \'re-plays\' a hole will receive a 3-shot penalty.</item>
        <item>Should further clarification of these rules be required, the course official will clear all ambiguity. They are also responsible for time-keeping and discipline. In the case of the latter, it is on all players to respect and uphold these rules.</item>
